# Strings are Arrays
# Like many other popular programming languages, strings in Python are arrays of unicode characters.

# However, Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1.

# Square brackets can be used to access elements of the string.

c = "Ansh Verma"
print(c[3])

# String Length
# To get the length of a string, use the len() function.

A = "Ansh Verma!"
print(len(A))
